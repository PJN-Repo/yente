The group was originally created in Jordan in the early 1990s under the name Bayat al Imam. The group associated with Al Qaida Core's senior leadership in 1999 and fought alongside Al Qaida Core and the Taliban during the US strikes in Afghanistan in late 2001. The group then transferred to Iraq in anticipation of the US led invasion, and, in October 2004, formally renamed itself \"Al Qaida in Iraq\" (AQI). The group has also operated under the name of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). In 2013, the group renamed itself the \"Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant\" (ISIL). In June 2014, the group renamed itself \"Islamic State\". The Islamic State's tactics include suicide attacks using vehicles and improvised explosive devices, armed attacks, hostage takings, and video-taped beheadings. In November 2015, IS claimed responsibility for coordinated attacks in six Paris locations that killed 120 and injured 200. Four months later, in March 2016, IS claimed responsibility for two bomb explosions at the Brussels Airport and another bomb explosion at the Maelbeek metro station near the offices of the European Union; these attacks killed 31 people and injured 340. IS also claimed responsibility for the May 22, 2017 suicide bombing during a concert at the Manchester Arena in the United Kingdom, which killed at least 22 people and injured hundreds more. In June and August 2017, IS claimed responsibility for three vehicular ramming attacks in the UK and Spain. These attacks killed at least 27 people, including 2 Canadians.","Review pursuant to Security Council resolution 1822 (2008) was concluded on 25 May 2010.
